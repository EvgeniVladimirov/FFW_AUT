Aut_task

Tried to automate some tasks using Java + Selenium, Maven, TestNG and Cucumber. Had a wrong approach using this, because it is my first time facing the cucumber framework. Didn't have any time left to fix current tests and to do some more.

After cloning the repo, simple update the Project -> Right click on project name -> Maven -> Update Project.

To run tests, right click on testng.xml file and Run As -> TestNg Suite.

Please install **Maven** and **Cucumber** plugins on your IDE before launching the tests.
